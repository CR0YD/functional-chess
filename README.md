# functional-chess

Like the title suggests, I'll try to implement a functional chess game in java.  
It's not the optimal language for such a project and there are many issues that I face.  
And the programm itself probably won't be a functional one, but I'll try to create one that  
resembles a functional programm as much as possible.  
Oh and thanks for having interest in my project, if somebody reads this at all.

There is much planned besides the core mechanics. If I find a way to dynamically load classes  
in java I'll try to create a chess core, where you can simply configure your own chess game  
with a unique board layout and even with fully configurable chess pieces.

But who knows how far I will make it...
